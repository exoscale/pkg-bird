bird (1.3.11-5) unstable; urgency=low

  BIRD now uses privilege separation to increase the security, so the daemon
  doesn't run with root privileges anymore.  This change also required to
  rework the packaging a little bit, so you need to be aware of:
  
  * The directory with configuration files had moved from /etc to /etc/bird/

  * The daemon now runs as bird:bird, the user and group can be configured
    in the /etc/bird/envvars configuration file

  * The run directory where control socket resides has been moved
    to /run/bird/
